# Patients Emergency Room Visit Dashboard

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive Emergency Room (ER) Visit Dashboard for a healthcare facility. This dashboard provides critical insights into patient demographics, visit types, satisfaction scores, wait times, referral departments, and other key metrics. These insights help healthcare administrators make data-driven decisions to enhance patient care quality, optimize resources, and improve operational efficiency.

### Steps to Create the Dashboard
- Step 1: Data Collection and Preparation

    Import the dataset into a data processing tool such as Python  or Excel.
    Perform data cleaning by handling missing values, renaming columns for readability, and formatting date fields.
    Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key attributes, trends, and outliers.

- Step 2: Data Transformation

    Extract relevant features such as Weekday/Weekend, Age Groups, and referral departments.
    Categorize age into specific groups (e.g., Infancy, Early Childhood, Teenager, Adult) to enable more granular analysis.
    Generate metrics such as total visits, average satisfaction scores, and wait times by department.

- Step 3: Dashboard Development

    Use a data visualization tool (e.g., Power BI, Tableau) to design the dashboard layout.
    Create key visualizations like bar charts, line graphs, and tables to display metrics such as total patient visits, satisfaction scores, department referrals, and patient demographics.
    Ensure that filters (e.g., Age, Gender, Department) are added to allow users to interact with and customize their view of the data.

- Step 4: Design and User Experience

    Apply a clean, easy-to-navigate layout with clear labeling and color coding.
    Incorporate visual indicators to show critical metrics (e.g., high satisfaction, low wait time) and interpretative text to guide users in understanding the dashboard.

- Step 5: Testing and Validation

    Test the dashboard for accuracy by verifying metrics against raw data calculations.
    Gather feedback from stakeholders to refine the visualizations and ensure the dashboard meets their needs.

- Step 6: Deployment and Maintenance

    Publish the dashboard to a shared environment or repository.
    Schedule regular updates to refresh data and maintain accurate reporting.
